NOTES ON THE COURSE

Contents of a websocket package:
["4", null, "lv:phx-F0p-z25g5JDGPAAB", "diff", {1: {0: "12", 1: "515"}}]
0: "4"                              ## JOIN REF
1: null                             ## MESSAGE REF
2: "lv:phx-F0p-z25g5JDGPAAB"        ## PHX CHANNEL TOPIC (each liveview connects to a unique phoneix channel)
3: "diff"                           ## EVENT

phx-debounce delays round trip to server on form changes

You can use this to inspect assigns in html
        <%= inspect(@matches) %>


!! import vs alias: import bring all functions in the file, alias requires the Module name be prefixed. IE) Boats.list_boats

In an .link, using href creates new liveview process by server doing a GET request where as using patch adds a special phoenix class to the resulting <a> 
to indicate that it's a 'patch' (JS intercepts the message)

navigate in a .link disconnects current live view process and mounts a new one!
